# StreamPolis

Strean Polis Project has started in the frame of the hackmoney hackathon.
This projects aims to be the one-stop shop for payments/services based upon superfluid

## Major problems it solves

Although the ability to stream payments with Superfluid is already on mainnet, the defi adopion is very low as there are no services offered for streams. 
Stream Polis should help solving this issue providing the required infrastructure to connect  Superfluid users : "streamers".

#### The major building blocks:

- Stream Home: Dashboard for all relevant services/portfolios of a streamer. 

- Agora. The place where services are offered to be paid on streams (mainly subscriptions)

- Company Saloon. Registry for companies willing to pay the salaries trough the stream polis. This will add a certain confidence for the services providers that the streamer will continue having the stream as is provided by the company (off chain verification)

- Lending Marketplace: Direct contact bewtween lenders and borrowers with specific stream and collateral.

- Exchanges (SwapStream.sol)

- ..



As for the sick of delivering somethingin the hackathon the first step will be the Stream Home and Lending Marketplace
